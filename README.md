## Introduction

[aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2) is a lightweight multi-protocol & multi-source command-line download utility.

It's easy to install aria2 on Linux (`apt install aria2`), however it's not easy to install aria2 on Windows (at least can't one-click to install).

So I build this python wheel to binding aria2 static build. You can install it by `pip` from `pypi` on Windows.

Now, we support:

- [x] manylinux_2_17_x86_64
- [x] musllinux_1_1_x86_64
- [x] manylinux_2_17_aarch64
- [x] musllinux_1_1_aarch64
- [x] win_amd64
- [x] win32

## Features

`aria2-wheel` internally bundles the aria2c binary and utilizes the [entry_point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#console-scripts) technology.

Therefore, it does not modify your system's `PATH` environment variable, and there is no need for `sudo` permissions.

You can completely uninstall it by running `pip uninstall aria2`.

## Credits

- [aria2](https://github.com/aria2/aria2)
    - This project is not `aria2` official project.
- [aria2-static-build](https://github.com/abcfy2/aria2-static-build)
    - The bound aria2 executable file directly comes from `aria2-static-build` project, and `aria2-wheel` assumes no responsibility for your use.
    - The license of `aria2-wheel` project is consistent with `aria2-static-build` project.

check `hatch_build.py` and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to know how we build the wheel.

## Install

```shell
pip install aria2
```

or install in global environment with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

```shell
# https://pypa.github.io/pipx/
pipx install aria2
```

## Usage

### cli usage

All api is the same as [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/manual/en/html/aria2c.html)

```shell
aria2c --help
```

or

```shell
python -m aria2c --help
```

`ctrl + c` , `ctrl + break` , `kill <pid>` will work well, even exit code.

### [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html)

Do not shutdown the subprocess by `Popen.terminate()` or `Popen.kill()`, which can not shutdown aria2 subprocess properly.

Use following code instead:

```python
import os
import signal
import subprocess
import sys
from subprocess import Popen
from typing import TypedDict


class Win32PopenKwargs(TypedDict):
    """Popen kwargs for Windows."""

    creationflags: int


class UnixPopenKwargs(TypedDict):
    """Popen kwargs for Unix."""

    start_new_session: bool


popen_kwargs = (
    UnixPopenKwargs(start_new_session=True)
    if sys.platform != "win32"
    else Win32PopenKwargs(creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP)
)


with Popen(args=("aria2c", "--enable-rpc"), **popen_kwargs) as p:
    try:
        # Do whatever you want here.
        ...
    finally:
        # following code can shutdown the subprocess gracefully.
        if sys.platform == "win32":
            # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44124338/trying-to-implement-signal-ctrl-c-event-in-python3-6
            os.kill(p.pid, signal.CTRL_BREAK_EVENT)
        else:
            os.killpg(os.getpgid(p.pid), signal.SIGINT)
```
